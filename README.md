# LangGraph Multi-Agent Sales Chatbot

This project is an AI-powered **multi-agent chatbot** built for e-commerce sales support. It leverages LangChain‚Äôs **LangGraph** framework to orchestrate multiple specialized agents, each handling a particular task. For example, one agent might handle product information queries while another handles store details. This multi-agent approach distributes responsibility among agents for better *task specialization* and efficiency. The chatbot uses a dataset of products and store information to answer questions like product availability, pricing, and store hours.

By routing user queries through a LangGraph *StateGraph*, the system maintains conversation context and ensures coherent multi-turn dialogue.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The chatbot is powered by a **LangGraph StateGraph**:

1. **Chatbot node** receives user input and determines intent.
2. Based on the intent, the message is routed to the appropriate **sub-agent**:
   - *ProductAgent* handles product-related questions.
   - *StoreAgent* handles store-related queries.
3. Each agent uses prompt templates and LLM calls to process requests.
4. LangGraph handles state transitions and memory, ensuring agents can work together across turns.

This **multi-agent setup** allows each part of the system to specialize in a domain while working together seamlessly.
